# Query Optimization Report

This report documents the process of optimizing a complex query that retrieves booking information along with related user, property, and payment details from the AirBnB clone database.

## Initial Query

The initial query joins multiple tables to retrieve comprehensive booking information:

```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.start_date,
    b.end_date,
    b.total_price,
    b.status,
    b.created_at AS booking_created_at,
    
    u.user_id,
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    u.email,
    u.phone_number,
    u.role,
    u.created_at AS user_created_at,
    
    p.property_id,
    p.name AS property_name,
    p.description,
    p.street_address,
    p.zip_code,
    p.pricepernight,
    p.created_at AS property_created_at,
    p.updated_at AS property_updated_at,
    
    l.city,
    l.state,
    l.country,
    
    h.user_id AS host_id,
    h.first_name AS host_first_name,
    h.last_name AS host_last_name,
    h.email AS host_email,
    h.phone_number AS host_phone_number,
    
    pay.payment_id,
    pay.amount,
    pay.payment_date,
    pay.payment_method,
    
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Review r WHERE r.property_id = p.property_id) AS review_count,
    (SELECT AVG(r.rating) FROM Review r WHERE r.property_id = p.property_id) AS average_rating
FROM 
    Booking b
JOIN 
    "User" u ON b.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN 
    Property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN 
    Location l ON p.location_id = l.location_id
JOIN 
    "User" h ON p.host_id = h.user_id
LEFT JOIN 
    Payment pay ON b.booking_id = pay.booking_id
ORDER BY 
    b.start_date DESC,
    b.created_at DESC;
```

## Performance Analysis

Using EXPLAIN ANALYZE, we identified several inefficiencies in the initial query:

### Identified Inefficiencies:

1. **Correlated Subqueries**: The query uses two correlated subqueries to calculate review count and average rating for each property, which are executed for each row in the result set.

2. **Excessive Columns**: The query retrieves many columns that might not be necessary for the application, increasing the data transfer overhead.

3. **No Filtering**: The query retrieves all bookings without any filtering, which could return a large result set.

4. **No Limit**: Without a LIMIT clause, the query returns all matching rows, which could be inefficient for pagination or display purposes.

5. **Multiple Scans**: The query performs multiple sequential scans on tables that could benefit from index usage.

## Optimization Strategies

Based on the performance analysis, we implemented the following optimizations:

1. **Replaced Correlated Subqueries with a Derived Table**: Pre-calculated review statistics once for all properties using a derived table (subquery) with GROUP BY.

2. **Reduced Column Selection**: Limited the columns to only those necessary for the application.

3. **Added Filtering**: Added a WHERE clause to filter out canceled bookings, reducing the result set size.

4. **Added LIMIT Clause**: Limited the result set to 100 rows, which is typically sufficient for a single page view.

5. **Leveraged Existing Indexes**: Ensured the query uses existing indexes on foreign keys and sorting columns.

 Planning Time: 1.542 ms
 Execution Time: 12.654 ms
```

### Performance Improvements:

1. **Execution Time Reduction**: The execution time decreased from 26.532ms to 12.654ms, a 52% improvement.

2. **Reduced Subplan Executions**: Eliminated the correlated subqueries that were executed for each row.

3. **Smaller Result Set**: Filtering out canceled bookings reduced the result set from 8 to 6 rows.

4. **More Efficient Joins**: The query optimizer could better plan the joins with the simplified query structure.

5. **Reduced Data Transfer**: Selecting fewer columns reduced the width of the result set from 1024 to 624 bytes per row.

## Conclusion

The optimized query achieves significant performance improvements through several key strategies:

1. **Eliminating Correlated Subqueries**: By pre-calculating review statistics once in a derived table, we avoided repeated calculations for each row.

2. **Reducing Data Volume**: By selecting only necessary columns, filtering out canceled bookings, and limiting the result set, we reduced the amount of data processed and transferred.

3. **Improving Query Structure**: The optimized query structure allows the database optimizer to generate a more efficient execution plan.

These optimizations resulted in a 52% reduction in execution time, which would be even more significant with larger datasets. The optimized query is not only faster but also more scalable as the database grows.

## Additional Recommendations

For further optimization, consider:

1. **Creating Additional Indexes**: Add indexes on frequently filtered columns like `b.status` and columns used in joins.

2. **Partitioning**: For very large tables, consider partitioning by date ranges or status.

3. **Materialized Views**: For frequently accessed data, consider creating materialized views that pre-compute complex aggregations.

4. **Query Caching**: Implement application-level caching for frequently executed queries.

5. **Pagination**: Implement keyset pagination instead of offset pagination for better performance with large datasets.
